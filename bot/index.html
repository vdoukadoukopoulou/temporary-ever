   <dt>so basically I read this wonderful article, and then I couldn't stop thinking about twitter bots, I was really suprised none of the museums were running their own bots <div class="sidenote"> earlier I had read <a href='http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694245'><i>Managing Contemporary Art Documentation in Museums and Special Collections</i></a> by Deena Engel and Glenn Wharton -- it was part of the reccomanded reading for the <a href="http://www.den.nl/agenda/bericht/6069">The Wikimedia, wikidata. A short introduction by Sandra Fauconnier</a>  Workshop -- as I tried to navigate the final archive myself, I got thinking about the <u>entry points</u> into navigating an archive.</div> </dt>

    <dt>I decided to build a twitterbot myself, and I started by using <a href="https://botwiki.org">botwiki.org</a><br> through it I was ablt to found the above guide <div class="sidenote">Here is sort of what I am thinking, and why I am suddently into building twitter bots:
    <ul class="three"> 
   <li>like a lot of things, online things tend to mimic their offline counterparts.</li>  

<li>browsing through archives is sort of the same thing, —</li>

<li>large collections are made available online for public to access , (example)</li> 

<li>along side a search bar, and a wide audience must navigate it, through the use 
of key words (example) </li>

<li>some search engines are capable of more complicated searches. (example)</li>

<li>some people have the courages to go through long hours of searching through things (example)</li> 

<li>others, or the majority more likely, don’t and some treasure are left hidden, at least until somebody discovers and posts it on twitter or reddit or somewhere else.</li>

<li>is it possible to create new entry points for people to search/discover/interact with  collections outside the search bar ? </li>

</ul>

    <div><u>Google Arts + Culture App Selfie-Paintings Doppelgängers</u></div>
   
    <div>In the midst of all this thinkging : Google Arts + Culture app broke their new selfie feature, and it took the world by storm, there were so many people posting about it my feed, that I decided to give it a try, to only find out that it was rolled out with geographical restrictions (aka only avialable in the US)<i>[update: turns out this might be beacause of EU’s regulations on facial recognition tech as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900392/art-selfie-facial-match-app-google-top-of-charts">(The Verge 17/01/18)</a>]</i>.</div>
    <div>Now, in my book this defiently qualifies as a new entry point to navigating collection. 
    Google spokesman Patrick Lenihan said it himself :“We’re always trying to figure out cool and interesting ways to get people talking about art, and this was one of them,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/01/15/somewhere-in-the-world-theres-a-painting-that-looks-like-you-and-google-will-find-it/?utm_term=.6c9e470ff2aa">(Washigthon Post 15/01/18).</a></div>
    <div>After you download the Google Arts + Culture app, and you scroll, you will run into a alert window prompting you to take a selfie so Google can find your doppelgängers in a collection of more than 70,000 paintings (Hello Giggles) in "more than 1,200 museums in over 70 countries"<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/01/15/somewhere-in-the-world-theres-a-painting-that-looks-like-you-and-google-will-find-it/?utm_term=.6c9e470ff2aa">(Washigthon Post 15/01/18)</a> Once your match has been found you can share it over socail media, as well as click through and learn more about the painting <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/app-attack-google-arts-and-culture/">(Digital Trends 16/01/18)</a>.</div>
    <div>As the app rolled out and gained popularity a lot of question arose: 
      <ul class="three">
       <li> Paul Soulellis tweeted a link to this article <a href="http://reallifemag.com/sick-of-myself/">Sick of Myself:Algorithmic identity is a means of control and consolation</a> on how " we feed goog, in return it feeds us the fantasy that we are knowable (and valuable)"</li>
       <li> On where google was using the application to train their AI. Google was quick to point out that that they didn't, practivally because they couldn't due to the way the app was build<a href="https://qz.com/1183296/googles-arts-culture-app-is-not-secretly-being-used-for-facial-recognition-training/">(Quartz 19/01/18)</a></li>
       <div class="fig">Fig.3</div>
       <li>But for me the most interesting observation came from Tea Uglow, she comments that "AI is structured to 'learn' from our culture and yet, the past is not where we want to go." The observation came from the fact that if you are not white, there is a very limited selection of paintings that you could "get matched with" or more accuretely represent you even in such a vast database. So basically if we keep looking based on what is there we will keep arriving on the same result. It could potentially be considered as a strech -- but what it makes me wonder -- is how do you build a thing to navigative or to create entrances for things that are there and simultaneously for things that are not ?</li></ul></div></dt>

<dt>It includes some general findings, like the actual amount of Institutions included, number of collections per country, etc. etc. I have an ongoing thread on the topic, for more interesting things I might come across:

      <div><u>Google Arts + Culture and modest operations</u></div>
        <div> I am planning to get away from Google Arts + Culture, cause it isn't really what I am here for. but I came across something rather interesting. After I pulled the numbers together, it was rather hard to figure out how the institutions that were included into the list were selected. For example, in The Netherlands (where I currently reside) Google Arts + Culture lists 24, while Wikipedia lists 65, of course both lists are incomplete, however it got me thinking how does Google Arts + Culture choose which institution to include? If you look on their website there is very little information, after digging you can find out how the affiliated institutions use Google Technologies, or come across their very first news blogspot,a celebatory post about their Partnership with Yad Vashem Word Holocaust Center. As I was about to let it go and move on, I run into this extremely interesting interview with Femke Snelting by Geraldine Juarez funnily enough entitled <a href="http://www.mondotheque.be/wiki/index.php/Google_Cultural_Institute">Google Cultural Institute</a>.</div>
       <div>Here is some insight on how the Mundaneum Archive was included in the collection:  
        <ul class="three">
      <li> "According to the responsible archivist Stephanie Manfroid, at one point the megacorporation has proposed the Federation Bruxelles Wallonie (formal owner of the archive) a contract to systematically digitize the archive, which was refused by the Federation. The digital documents that subsequently appeared on the Google Cultural Institute website were supposedly released "for communication purposes".The Mundaneum decided to redirect their own institutional URL: http://digitalarchives.mundaneum.org to the GCI section dedicated to them points to Mundaneum's own website. This erases all sense of difference between the public and the commercial 'institutes'. Also, the draconian terms and conditions of Google are maintained so the borders between responsibility, rights and ownership are being blurred. Since February this year, Mundaneum has started to publish some of its digital documents on Wikimedia Commons under correct conditions so that is encouraging." </li>
      <br>
      <li>"GCI can take their pseudo-governmental stance because it does not need to directly serve commercial needs, just because they can. By building 'strong partnerships' with public institutions such as Mundaneum but also for example Ghent University library, they manage to keep attention on their mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", away from being an advertising company that is good at avoiding taxes."</li> 
      <br>
      <li>"That it has nothing to do with what we should expect from Culture, nor with what we should demand from an Institution. From the perspective of the megacorporation, culture is just another type of information to be accessed, whereby all that access means is allowing people to call up an image in a slick interface, hopefully with an infantile description attached[..] By staying shallow, they can reap the reassuring effects of 'heritage' and 'archive', and in the case of Mundaneum there's a bonus of a retro-activated European history. [..] It shows how much public institutions are not just structurally corrupt but actively contribute to the corruption of language, allowing the borders (or the URLs) between concepts to blur.  </li>
      <br>
      <div>And to drive it home:</div>
      <br>
      <li>"I think it is exactly because of the urgency of the situation that we should resist bold gestures, and find the patience to build a relation to these histories in ways that makes sense. We will need to be both responsive to and responsible for the specific material entanglements that we will encounter. The point of those modest operations, is to build the collective courage to persist in demanding access to both the documents and the intellectual and technological instruments that interface them. Only than can we develop infrastructures for knowledge production that go beyond the current techno-determinist paradigm. And for this, access to infrastructure and data is a prerequisite, but imagination is indispensable."</li>

    </ul> 
    
    <div>the original plan was to have a bot that would call through the API and then display things, it would be easy to use, and the person overseeing the bot would just, input the new term in a straight-forward input field, but i then I realised (since starting to work with the Sonic Acts collection) that smaller places don't have that type of recources they barely have organised collection. So perphaps the tool should be more versatile and also accomodate smaller collections.</div>
