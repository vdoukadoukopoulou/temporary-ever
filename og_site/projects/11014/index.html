        <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/127137928">11014 155023 _ 155027</a> is an analog cameraless 8mm black and white film, created by exposing the whole cartridge of Kodak Tri-X super8 (15m) to light on 16/02/2014 between 15:50:23 -15:50:27. the material of film serves at the same time both as the medium and the subject of the film, as it captures itself. when displayed, it is projected in a 9fps tempo rounding up the film's duration to ~ 7 min [instead of 3,5 min when played in 24fps or 5 sec that time at it actually documents] and by doing so it expands time unlike usual cinematic time that contracts real time.
        </p>

        <p>second experiment in a series of an ongoing research 11014 155023 _ 155027 that strips filmmaking to the it's basis : light, time and record </p>

        <p>the experimentation started on photographic 35 mm film by the process of elimination, slowly reducing the equipment used in the process of capturing. 080114 155000_155005 that exposes a whole roll of film to a light source in motion within a reflective surface and followed by 161213 135030_135032 that eliminates motion and container to exposing the whole roll of film directly to a stationery light source</p>

        <!--    <p>all experimentation besides actual film was done in colour, the the elimination of the colour possibility came from a comment about Peter Kubelka's Arnulf Rainer that “Arnulf Rainer is not merely a study of film rhythm and flicker. In reducing the cinema to its essentials, Kubelka has not stripped it of meaning, but rather made an object which has qualities so general as to suggest a variety of possible meanings, each touching on some essential aspect of existence.” </p> --->
