				<p>
					films are like plants <br> they can’t grow without time <br> and light <br>
				</p>

				<p>
					the only difference between plants and films is that <br> film is dead <br> and plants are alive <br>
				</p>

				<p>
					Would it be possible to have an alive film ? <br> A film that grows as it is being ? <br> Something that has no set form ? <br>

					Algae are a very large and diverse group of eukaryotic <a target="_blank" class="tooltips circle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae">organisms<span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae</span></a>. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that occur in most habitats, ranging from marine and freshwater to desert sands and from hot boiling springs to snow and ice. They vary from small, single-celled forms to complex multicellular forms, such as the giant kelps of the eastern Paci c that grow to more than 60 meters in length and form dense marine forests. Algae are found in the fossil record dating back to approximately 3 billion years in the Precambrian. They exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple, asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual <a target="_parent" class="tooltips circle" href="http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm">reproduction<span>http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm</span></a>. <i>algae is, at least the one i am living and working with, algae she is, single minded, strong minded and whole.</i>

				<p class="white_space">eventually i went to pick up some more and i found out that the algae in the park has died as well, perhaps it was a seasonal thing perhaps i was incapable of doing it. it was extremely frustrating and devastating in any case. </P>

				<p class="white_space"> upon the occasion of all the deaths measurements where taken : online research concludes that algae likes breathing</p>

				<p>The carbon dioxide is consumed by the algae which release oxygen. The bottle contains a solution of water, algae and nutrients. Room air is passed through the bottles using a standard aquarium bubbler stone where the CO2 is absorbed by the algae and oxygen <a target="_parent" class="tooltips circle" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Algae-Home-CO2-Scrubber-Part-1/">released<span>http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Algae-Home-CO2-Scrubber-Part-1/</span></a>.</p>

				<p> It seems like this is the reason why people with aquariums have so much algae growth and look for ways to avoid it.</p>

				<p>there wasn’t any film placed, focusing on keeping the algae alive seemed more important at the moments</p>

				<h2>observation through november</h2>

				<p> what thought to be blooming algae turns out to be ‘duckweed’ → as a derivative it seems that there actually early any algae on the collection for the ‘oxygen set up’ Duckweeds, or water lens, are owering aquatic plants which oat on or just beneath the surface of still or slow-moving bodies of fresh water and wetlands</p>

				<p>there was another container collected that seemed to be a mix of algae and duckweed, dead the following day a er brought home</p>

				<p>bottles had to be refilled with water constantly especially bottle A , bottle B was doing better in the start now acts just like bottle A dead</p>

				<p>bottle A showed signs of fast algae growth but then remained stationary <br> it turns out to be some sort of slimy bio lm, not actual growth</p>

				<p>algae from the original collection small containers A & B show proper signs of growth <u><b>& seem alive</b></u></p>

				<p>the majority of the information I find is through aquarium maintenance forums perhaps, with that in mind I visited a aquarium supply store their aquarium had a little bit of algae growing on them, and they mostly sold stuff to kill algae, but I already do that for free however the rather helpful store manager provided me with a flyer identifying type of algae and product against. perhaps if I identify algae it will help me find the nutrients it’s missing or the environment it mind to remain alive</p>
				<img class="img_100" src="img/small/IMG_4498.jpg" alt="">

				<p>algae from containers A & B were observed under the microscope, things are moving, it’s aliiiiiiveeeeee! it’s aliiiiiiiiveeeeee!</p>

				<img class="img_100" src="img/small/microscope_2.jpg" alt="">

				<p>there is also some algae growth on the clear lm leader</p>

				<p>the lm was also observed under the microscope, and things are moving as well, it’s <u>so alive</u></p>

				<p>Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 μm in diameter, and is without agella. Chlorella contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. rough photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to <a target="_blank" class="tooltips circle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella">reproduce<span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella</span></a></p>

				<h2>then i talked to somebody who actually knows things</h2>

				<p>through following the live life, life live research course that run in cooperation with the waag society, i was able to meet maria boto ordonez, a biologist who currently also straggles with algae growth</p>
				<ul>
					<li>it was pointed out to me,that just because bacteria are moving it doesn’t mean it’s alive</li>
					<li>it was also explained to me that algae likes CO2, and not oxygen, <a target="_blank" class="tooltips circle" href="">yeast<span>when that was tried algae died within one week</span></a> produces CO2 and linking containers with the two of them helps maximise algae growth</li>
					<li>oxygen set up was updated, however I decided stop refilling them bottle B & C are doing badly</li>
					<li>the weekly follow up showed : container C DEAD , bottle B duckweed is brown, no algae growth, container A & B show no further growth</li>

				<h3>algae under the microscope</h3>

				<p>algae of container A & B (from first collection) were examined under the microscope</p>
				<img class="img_100" src="img/small/maria microscope.jpg" alt="">

				<p>algae is alive in container A, container B has been living in my bag for almost a week is not doing as well (probably from sun deprivation) however it is not completely dead</p>
				<img class="img_100" src="img/small/maria_microscope.jpg" alt="">

				<p>several species of algae were identified, given that algae was collected outside , it is no a clean sample :</p>

				<p>closterium algae(few) <br> clamidomonas algae <br> dunaliella algae (swimming algae)<br> some sort of string algae<br> [made clearly visible when the bio lm was stained with methane blue dye]<br> a pyrenoid algae structure was found as well</p>

				<h3>the aliveness issue</h3>

				<p>during the initial collection a petri dish was also issued to contain sample & film but it was forgotten in my balcony alone side with the collection bottle it turns out they have remained alive.</p>

				<p>no food, temperature adjustment or extra sunlight was provided, sometimes they weren’t even protected from rain however they remained alive. how ?</p>

				<p>it seems rather bizarre, that it reinforces my idea that algae likes to be left alone, seems to grow better uninterrupted. i had the opportunity to present my algae growing process in an open evening at the waag, and someone from the audience commented that the reason why it grows so well in the aquariums it is exactly because it’s left alone and uninterrupted .</p>

				<p>she and i aren’t all that different after all,we like to do things at are one rate and tempo.</p>
