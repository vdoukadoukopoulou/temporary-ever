        <p> efforts into breathing compiles three works: <a href="https://vimeo.com/84543553">breath one</a>, exercises on breath and <a href="https://vimeo.com/128074440">aeration</a> all exploring breathing as a medium </p>

        <p>breath one was created as a part of MADCOW, and it takes the form of a soft plastic performative installation, it was created to explore the differences between the industrial architectural space and the tactile materiality of it. </p>

        <p>exercises on breath is a live performative installation of Samuel Beckett's breath for 6 audience members, 3 performers ,scent and lights to be repeated 3 times in 3 spaces.the work builds upon the Beckett piece and explores the idea of abstracting life through the senses, Beckett's piece in 8 lines successfully captures a whole life from birth to death and reduces it into it's fundamental functions : breath, sound and light. exercises on breath goes a step further by eliminating the stage set up, the placement of the rubbish and substituting the vagitus cry with the smell of vanilla. </p>

        <p>aeration was created as a part of Sonic Labs: Sonic Air Spaces and continues the exploration of the differences between the industrial architectural space and the tactile materiality of it. in the form of a large plastic inflatable installation, aeration inflates by use of organ pump to transforms the space, slowly taking over and separating the crowd, forcing it to explore the upstairs.
